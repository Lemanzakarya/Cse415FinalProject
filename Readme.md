# Task Management Solution with Email Notifications

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple Azure services to build a robust task management system with real-time email notifications. The solution leverages an event-driven architecture to enhance user experience by notifying users of task updates promptly.

## Overview
The Task Management Solution combines several Azure services, providing a seamless integration for creating, updating, and managing tasks while delivering email notifications when tasks are created or updated. The architecture ensures scalability, security, and responsiveness, making it a suitable foundation for modern cloud-based applications.

### Key Features
1. **Task Management**: A secure, cloud-ready web application built on MVC architecture, allowing CRUD operations for task management.
2. **Database Integration**: Azure Cosmos DB serves as the database backend, ensuring high availability and low latency for task storage and retrieval.
3. **Event-Driven Notifications**: Azure Functions monitor the Cosmos DB change feed, triggering email notifications for task updates in real-time.
4. **Email Service**: Azure Communication Services (ACS) handles email notifications, utilizing a free Azure-provided subdomain for verified sender addresses.
5. **Secure Configuration**: Azure Key Vault and App Configuration securely store and manage connection strings and secrets, enabling secure and scalable application deployments.

### High-Level Workflow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the MVC web application to create, update, or manage tasks.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - Task data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
3. **Change Detection**:
   - The Cosmos DB change feed detects data modifications (insertions or updates).
4. **Function Invocation**:
   - An Azure Function is triggered by the change feed to process the updates.
5. **Email Notification**:
   - The Azure Function sends email notifications using ACS to alert users about task updates.

### Benefits
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instant notifications improve user engagement and productivity.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based architecture supports scaling as the application grows.
- **Security**: Azure services like Key Vault and managed identities ensure secure handling of sensitive data.
- **Low Maintenance**: Serverless architecture reduces operational overhead.

### Prerequisites
To deploy and utilize this solution, ensure the following:
- Azure account with sufficient permissions.
- Basic knowledge of .NET, Azure Functions, and Azure services like Cosmos DB, ACS, and Key Vault.

### Future Enhancements
- Extend notification mechanisms to include SMS or push notifications.
- Implement advanced user preferences for customized notification settings.
- Integrate analytics for monitoring notification efficiency and user interactions.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Azure services can be orchestrated to deliver a scalable and secure task management solution with real-time notifications. By leveraging event-driven architecture and serverless technologies, it provides a foundation for building modern, responsive cloud applications.
